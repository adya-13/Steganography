# Steganography
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination.\
This code uses least significant bit technique to encode and decode messages in an image.\
In this technique, least significant bit of pixels of the image is replaced with data bits.\
This technique is very efficient because of its simplicity and its ability to be undetectable to the naked eye.
